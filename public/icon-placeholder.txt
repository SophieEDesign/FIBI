PWA Icons Required

For the PWA to work properly, you need to create two icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These should be placed in the /public directory.

You can create these using any image editor or use an online PWA icon generator.
Make sure the icons represent the Fibi app brand.
