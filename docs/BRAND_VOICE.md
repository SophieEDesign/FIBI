# FIBI Brand Voice

**Core personality:** Calm. Clear. Considered.

FIBI doesn’t shout. It doesn’t rush. It doesn’t oversell. It feels like a thoughtful friend who quietly has everything organised.

## Tone Pillars

### 1. Calm, Not Chaotic
- **Instead of:** “Stop losing your saved posts NOW!!!”
- **FIBI says:** “Keep your travel ideas in one calm place.”
- Language is: gentle, grounded, assured.

### 2. Aspirational, But Real
- **Instead of:** “Live your best travel life.”
- **FIBI says:** “That café you saved. The beach you meant to visit.”
- Speak in specifics. Reference real moments. Feel human.

### 3. Organised, Not Complicated
- **Avoid:** workflow, optimisation, productivity stack, smart algorithm.
- **Use:** save, organise, plan, keep, see. Simple verbs. No jargon.

---

## Sentence Style
- Short sentences.
- White space.
- Gentle rhythm.

**Example:**  
*You keep saving places. We help you keep them organised.*

**Never:**  
*FIBI is a cutting-edge travel inspiration management platform designed to streamline digital discovery workflows.*

---

## Microcopy Style

**Buttons (preferred):**
- “Save to trip”
- “Add to map”
- “Start a new trip”
- “Keep this place”

**Avoid:** “Create record”, “Submit”, “Execute action”

---

## Emotional Angle
*You don’t need to be chaotic to be inspired.*

FIBI is for: thoughtful travellers, quiet planners, people who screenshot too much, dreamers who want structure.
